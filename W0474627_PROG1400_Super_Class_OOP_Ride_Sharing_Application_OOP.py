# 1. **Encapsulation**: Data and methods are encapsulated within classes. Each class (`Person`, `Driver`, `Rider`, `Route`, `Trip`) encapsulates relevant attributes and methods.
# 2. **Inheritance**: `Driver` and `Rider` inherit from `Person`, inheriting its attributes and methods.
# 3. **Polymorphism**: The `details()` method is polymorphic - it behaves differently based on the object calling it. Each class implements its own version of the `details()` method, tailored to its specific attributes.
# 4. **Abstraction**: Users interact with the classes through their interfaces (`details()` method), hiding the complexities of their implementations.

# The __name__ variable is a special variable that holds the name of the current
# module. When a Python script is executed, Python sets the __name__ variable
# for that script to "__main__", indicating that the script is being run directly,
# and not imported as a module.
# The line if __name__ == "__main__": is a common idiom used in Python scripts.
# It checks if the current script is being run directly by the Python interpreter.
# If so, it executes the block of code inside the if statement.
# This is useful when you have a Python file that can be both imported as a module
# in other scripts and run as a standalone script.
